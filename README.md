## Introduction
This repository contains code and instructions for training a custom object detection model using YOLOv9. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. This project aims to provide an easy-to-follow guide for setting up, training, and evaluating a custom object detection model.

## Features
- State-of-the-art YOLOv9 model
- Custom dataset training
- Easy-to-use scripts for training and evaluation
- High performance and accuracy

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/custom-yolov9.git
   cd custom-yolov9
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv yolov9-env
   source yolov9-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `yolov9-env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset Preparation
1. **Collect and annotate your dataset:** Use tools like [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) to annotate your images in Pascal VOC format.

2. **Organize your dataset:** Structure your dataset as follows:
   ```
   dataset/
   ├── images/
   │   ├── train/
   │   └── val/
   └── labels/
       ├── train/
       └── val/
   ```

3. **Convert annotations (if needed):** Ensure annotations are in YOLO format.

## Training
1. **Configure training parameters:** Modify the `config.yaml` file to set your training parameters, such as batch size, epochs, and learning rate.

2. **Start training:**
   ```sh
   python train.py --config config.yaml
   ```

## Evaluation
1. **Evaluate the model:**
   ```sh
   python evaluate.py --weights path/to/weights.pt --data dataset.yaml
   ```

2. **View evaluation metrics:** The evaluation script will output metrics such as mAP, precision, and recall.

## Inference
1. **Run inference on images or videos:**
   ```sh
   python detect.py --weights path/to/weights.pt --source path/to/images_or_video
   ```

2. **Results:** The results will be saved in the `runs/detect` directory.

## Results
Include some sample images or results from your trained model here to showcase its performance.
